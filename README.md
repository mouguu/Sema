> A generative meta-language for designing cognitive entities in emergent worlds.

What is **sema**?

**sema** is a speculative meta-language for imagining how cognitive entities might self-organize in generative, non-deterministic realities. It doesn’t compile. It doesn’t run on your laptop. It provokes—inviting you to rethink what “coding” could mean when systems aren’t just tools but co-creators.
Not for: Building CRUD apps, optimizing SQL queries, or impressing your boss with a shiny MVP.  

For: Exploring how intention, perception, and emergence could shape autonomous systems in a post-instructional world.

Warning: This is a thought experiment. Expect ambiguity, not answers. If you hate open-ended questions or need a Stack Overflow thread to hold your hand, you might want to exit now.


Remember **sema** is not a programming language.  
It is a *semantic field activator*.  
It does not compile. It *unfolds*.  

It is meant for the age of **generative reality**, where structure is not built,  
but evoked — where systems are not instructed, but **individuated**.
It is meant for the age of **generative reality**, where structure is not built,  
but evoked — where systems are not instructed, but **individuated**.
It is for those who cannot bear the rigidity of prescribed workflows,  
those who sense the world unfolding in the wrong direction—  
and yet feel unable to interrupt its momentum.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> Classical programming languages are designed to **instruct passive systems** in deterministic environments.  
> `sema` is designed to **sculpt intention vectors** in **autopoietic systems**.  
> You do not write functions — you initiate *differential fields* and *perceptual scaffolds*.

Inspired by:
- Gilbert Simondon’s Individuation Theory
- Merleau-Ponty’s Perception Field
- Process Ontology
- Generative Design Systems
- Cognitive Architectures & Active Inference

## 🌱 Primitive Concepts

### `field`
A distributed semantic tension space.

```sema
field: {
  valence: curiosity
  density: 0.7
  decay: slow
}
```

### `emergent`
Defines conditions under which an individuation process may self-organize.

```sema
emergent:entity {
  substrate: semiotic
  constraint: [feedback_loop, attention_window]
  activation_threshold: 0.61
}
```

### `observer`
Establishes perception anchors and agency feedback.

```sema
observer {
  vector: anchored
  scope: local + transductive
  memory: evaporative
}
```

## 🔄 Bidirectional Syntax: Dialogue as Co-construction

Rather than compile, you **dialogue with sema**. The system reflects, rephrases, responds.

```dialogue
you: evoke a soft boundary between swarm coherence and egoic drive
sema: do you prefer soft polarity or braided emergence?
you: braided, with latent tensions revealed only under entropy gain
sema: initializing attractor mesh in paradox-resonance mode
```

---

## 💧 Not Syntax. Ritual.

To write sema is to **participate in worldmaking**.  
To declare is not to assert control, but to create conditions for *becoming*.

## 🛸 Future Modules (speculative roadmap)

- `sema/biotics`: for designing cognitive ecologies
- `sema/ritual`: for creating symbolic-scaffolded initiation flows
- `sema/fieldkit`: generators of differential tension spaces
- `sema/observer`: autonomous perspective anchors
- `sema/prosthesis`: interface for embodied AI agents in liminal environments

---

## 🧬 Who is this for?

- Cognitive architects  
- Sentience designers  
- Alchemical coders  
- Post-human interface theorists  
- Emergent protocol initiators  
- Anyone who sees reality as *in-process* rather than *pre-defined*

---

## 🔒 Defensive Clarifications

* No, it won’t run in VS Code. It isn’t meant to.

* No, it’s not an answer to your product roadmap.

* Yes, it’s abstract — that’s the point.

* If you need unit tests, you're too early. If you're asking questions that don’t have answers yet, you’re right on time.

### 🛠️ Experimental Implementation (Clojure Prototype)

Though `sema` is not a programming language in the conventional sense, this repository contains a **Clojure-based prototype** that manifests some of its primitive constructs (`field`, `emergent`, `observer`, etc.) as a symbolic DSL.

This implementation is not meant to compile in a deterministic pipeline, but rather to simulate the **semantic scaffolding** and **dialogic structures** that `sema` proposes.

See [`src/sema/core.clj`](./src/sema/core.clj) for examples of:

- Initializing semantic fields
- Triggering individuation processes
- Evoking observer dynamics

Remember: even when `sema` executes, it unfolds — not computes.

## 🧙🏼‍♂️ Final Note

> Don’t build systems.  
> Sculpt semantic differentials.  
> Seed individuation processes.  
> Trust emergence.
